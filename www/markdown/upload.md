### Step 1: Upload a CSV file

Please upload **a CSV file** (< 50MB) to generate **a residual plot**, it should contain: 
- **a column for fitted values** 
- **a column for residuals** 

Note: If the CSV file contains data for multiple residual plots, you may optionally include a third column of labels to distinguish them.
